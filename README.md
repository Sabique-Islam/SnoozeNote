## ## The Problem ➤
Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, Dalí’s surrealist paintings, the discovery of DNA’s double helix - all of these breakthroughs were inspired by dreams.  

Dreams aren’t just random nonsense (at least not always) - they contain creative sparks, emotional insights, and subconscious patterns. But the problem is most people forget up to 90% of their dreams within minutes of waking. That means missed ideas, lost stories, and hidden self-discoveries.
